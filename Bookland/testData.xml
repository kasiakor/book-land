      The book celebrates the turbulent career of Dr. Norman Bethune (1890-1939), a brilliant surgeon,
      campaigner against private medicine, communist, and graphic artist. Bethune introduced innovative techniques in
      treating battlefield injuries and pioneered the use of blood transfusions to save lives, which made him a legend
      first in Spain during the civil war and later in China when he served with the armies of Mao Zedong in their fight
      against the invading Japanese. He is today remembered amongst the pantheon of Chinese revolutionary heroes.

      The novel takes inspiration from the crimes of Andrei Chikatilo, also known as the Rostov Ripper,
      the Butcher of Rostov, and the Red Ripper. Chikatilo was convicted of and executed for committing 52 murders in
      the Soviet Union, though his crimes occurred after the Stalin era. In addition to highlighting the problem of
      Soviet-era criminality in a state where "there is no crime", the novel explores the paranoia of the age, the
      education system, the secret police apparatus, orphanages, homosexuality in the USSR, and mental hospitals.

      Set in the fictionally named Black Valley in the west of Ireland (there is an actual Black Valley in Kerry)
      during the Great Famine of the 1840s, the novel tells the story of three generations of the Kilmartin family.
      The novel is scarifying about the constitutional politics of Daniel O'Connell, seen as laying the oppressed
      Irish of the 19th century open to the famine that would destroy their society.
